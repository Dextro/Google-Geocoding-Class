Google Geocoding Class
======================
What
----
> Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers or position the map. The Google Maps API Geocoding Service provides a direct way to access a geocoder via an HTTP request.

This class can be used to geocode addresses or reverse geocode latitudes and longitudes in a very easy way.

Documentation
-------------
The class is well documented inline. If you use a decent IDE you'll see that each method is documented with PHPDoc.
